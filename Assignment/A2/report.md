### Sample sizes of the groups according to Sensitive Features

- Age and Readmission
![age](pics/age_readmit.png)
The data is biased towards samples with older age. The data size grows as the age increases.

- Race and Readmission
![race](pics/race_readmit.png)
The data is biased towards `Caucasian` and `AfricanAmerican`. `Caucasian` has the largest sample size.

- Gender and Readmission
![gender](pics/gender_readmit.png)
The data is relatively balanced.

## 2. Model Training

Please refer to the `train.ipynb` file for the data analysis and model training. A Logistic Regression model is trained with an accuracy of 0.63 on the test set.

## 3. Quantify Fairness

Please refer to the `fairness.ipynb` for more details.

## 4. Evaluation

### Demographic Parity

Demographic Parity measures the equality of prediction outcomes across different sensitive groups. It is achieved when the probability of a certain prediction is not dependent on sensitive group membership.

The results indicate that the `African American` group has the highest proportion of positive predictions (0.3929), followed by the `Caucasian` group (0.3807).  

The maximum difference is observed between the `African American` and `Unknown`.

In this metric, the model is biased towards the `African American` and `Caucasian` groups, with the `Asian` and `Unknown` groups having the lowest proportion of being readmitted.

### Equalized Opportunity

It means the protected and unprotected groups should have equal true positive rates.

The `Caucasian` group has the highest TPR (0.1444). Others have much lower TPR values. The maximum difference is observed between the `Caucasian` and `Asian` groups (0.1441). 

The smallest ratio is found between the `Asian` and `Caucasian` groups.

In this metric, the model is biased towards the `Caucasian` group, with the `Asian` group having the lowest TPR.

### Equalized Odds

Equalized Odds means the protected and unprotected groups should have equal true positive rates and false positive rates.

We discuss the false positive rates, since the true positive rates are the same as the `Equalized Opportunity` metric.

The `Caucasian` group has the highest FPR(0.2693). Others have much lower FPR values. The maximum difference is still observed between the `Caucasian` and `Asian` groups. 

The smallest ratio is found between the `Asian` and `Caucasian` groups.

In this metric, the model is biased towards the `Caucasian` group, tending to predict the `Caucasian` group as readmitted.

### Conditional Statistical Parity

Conditional Statistical Parity means the protected and unprotected groups should have equal true positive rates conditioned on a third variable(legitimate factors L).

L = `gender, age`

- L = ('Male', '30-60 years')
      The `African American` group has the highest proportion of positive predictions (0.3582), followed by the `Caucasian` group (0.3179). The maximum difference is observed between the `African American` and `Unknown` groups.
      The model is biased towards the `African American` and `Caucasian` groups, with the `Asian` and `Unknown` groups having the lowest proportion of being readmitted.

- L = ('Male', 'Over 60 years')
      The `Hispanic` group has the highest proportion of positive predictions (0.4741), followed by the `AfricanAmerican` group . The maximum difference is observed between the `Hispanic` and `Unknown` groups.
      The model is biased towards the `Hispanic` and `AfricanAmerican` groups, with the `Asian` and `Unknown` groups having the lowest proportion of being readmitted.

- L = ('Male', '30 years or younger')
      Same as above, the model is biased towards the `Hispanic` and `AfricanAmerican` groups, with the `Asian` and `Unknown` groups having the lowest proportion of being readmitted (**even  `0`!**).

- L = ('Female', '30-60 years')
      Same. Biased towards the `Caucasian` and `AfricanAmerican` groups, with the `Asian` and `Unknown` groups having the lowest proportion of being readmitted.

- L = ('Female', 'Over 60 years')
      Same. Biased towards the `Caucasian` and `AfricanAmerican` groups, with the `Asian` and `Unknown` groups having the lowest proportion of being readmitted.

- L = ('Female', '30 years or younger')
      Biased towards the `Caucasian` and `Other` groups, with the `Asian` and `Unknown` groups having the lowest proportion of being readmitted (**even  `0`**!). 

## 5. Conclusion

The model is mostly biased towards the `Caucasian` group, then the `AfricanAmerican` and `Hispanic` groups, indicated by the tendency to predict these groups as readmitted. While the `Asian` and `Unknown` groups have the lowest proportion of being readmitted. 

This is related to the imbalance of the dataset, where the `Caucasian` group has the largest sample size, then the `AfricanAmerican` group. The `Asian` and `Unknown` groups have the smallest sample size.
